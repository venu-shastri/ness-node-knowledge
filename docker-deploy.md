#### Deploying Nodejs Application Using Docker

---

##### **How is Docker helpful for Node.js developers?**

> Packaging your Node.js application in a container allows you to bundle your complete application, including the runtime, configuration and OS-level dependencies, and everything required you web application to run across different platforms and CPU architectures. These images are bundled as deployable artifacts called container images. These Docker images are software-based bundles enabling easily reproducible builds, and give Node.js developers a way to run the same project or product in all environments. Docker containers allow developers to experiment more easily with new platform releases or other changes without requiring special permissions, or setting up a dedicated environment to run a project



## Steps

- ###### Create a Dockerfile that describes how Docker will build your application.

  ```
  touch dockerfile
  ```
